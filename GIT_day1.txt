-------------GIT DAY 1------------
Git is primarily a distributed version control system. You can work on your code step-by-step, saving each step’s progress along the way in case you need rollback to a backup copy.

Repository (shortly “Repo”) a project that contains multiple files. In our case a repository will contain code-base files. There are two hosting platforms to host our repositories. One, Online (On the cloud) and second, Offline (Self-installed on your server). There are three most popular Git hosting services. They are GitHub (Owned by Microsoft), GitLab (Owned by GitLab) and BitBucket.

git --version : to check which version of git is installed

To enable coloring:

1. check if it already exists: git config color.ui
2. if not, do: git config --global color.ui true



To setup username and email:
git --config user.name "xyz"
git --config user.email "xyz@abc.com"


-----Initialising git------

Navigate to the directory you want to setup version control for in the terminal.
	git init

This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet.

-----Add to track-----

1. git add filename
2. git add . ----for all files
